# VTU-AIML-Lab-Programs
1. Implement A* Search algorithm. 
2. Implement AO* Search algorithm. 
3. For a given set of training data examples stored in a .CSV file, implement and demonstrate the 
Candidate-Elimination algorithmto output a description of the set of all hypotheses consistent 
with the training examples. 
4. Write a program to demonstrate the working of the decision tree based ID3 algorithm. Use an 
appropriate data set for building the decision tree and apply this knowledge toclassify a new sample. 
5. Build an Artificial Neural Network by implementing the Backpropagation algorithm and test the 
same using appropriate data sets. 
6. Write a program to implement the na√Øve Bayesian classifier for a sample training data set stored 
as a .CSV file. Compute the accuracy of the classifier, considering few test data sets. 
7. Apply EM algorithm to cluster a set of data stored in a .CSV file. Use the same data set for 
clustering using k-Means algorithm. Compare the results of these two algorithms and comment 
on the quality of clustering. You can add Java/Python ML library classes/API in the program. 
8. Write a program to implement k-Nearest Neighbour algorithm to classify the iris data set. Print 
both correct and wrong predictions. Java/Python ML library classes can be used for this problem. 
9. Implement the non-parametric Locally Weighted Regressionalgorithm in order to fit data points. 
Select appropriate data set for your experiment and draw graphs
